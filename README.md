E-Commerce Sales Data Analysis
This project is a hands-on exploration of real-world e-commerce sales data collected from multiple online platforms. The main aim is to clean messy raw data, understand pricing behavior across platforms, and extract useful business insights that can support better decision-making.
The analysis is done step by step using Python in a Jupyter Notebook, following a structured data analytics workflow similar to what is used in real industry projects.
