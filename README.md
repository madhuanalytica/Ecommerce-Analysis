# E-Commerce Sales Data Analysis 📊

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing multi-platform e-commerce sales data to derive meaningful business insights. The dataset includes product-level pricing, margins, and sales information across various platforms such as Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, Ajio, and others. The goal is to clean, preprocess, and analyze the data to support data-driven decision-making.
